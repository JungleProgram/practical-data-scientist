# :writing_hand: Prepwork
---

This prepwork will test your **beginner python skills**. It will also help you setup your **python workstation**, and get you started with **jupyter notebooks**. Upon successful completion, you will be ready to start [The Practical Data Scientist](../README.md).

## :checkered_flag: Getting Started

1. Open the [workstation setup](workstation_setup.ipynb) notebook
2. Follow the instructions on your local machine to setup and get acquainted with python, pipenv, jupyter, and git
3. Don't forget the :muscle: exercises!
4. Clone this repository with git, and run a local jupyter notebook
5. Open your local copy of the  [prepwork](prepwork.ipynb) notebook
6. Complete it by filling in the code cells where commented
7. Save the notebook
8. Send us the `prepwork.ipynb` file directly on discord

## :thinking: FAQ

#### How long does this take to complete?

Depending on your level of python, it could take anything from one to a few hours. The most important isn't how fast you're going, but how **comfortable** you are. If it already hurts writing code, learning Data Science is not going to be fun!

#### Is there a deadline?

No, you may join the next cohort if you miss this one.

#### Why is this a test?

This course has beginner python prerequisites, and is taught as a **micro class**. This means that places are limited, and that group learning is essential for the success of the whole cohort. For this, all students must start at similar skills levels. 

#### What are the evaluation criteria?

Your code must be **functional** and of **good quality**. Code quality includes correct method usage, clarity, and conciseness.

#### I'm stuck with the workstation setup, can you help out?

Maybe, some operating systems make this step difficult. Please reach out to one of the course teachers to check if something is wrong.

#### I'm stuck with the code challenges, can you help out?

No, take a break and try again :)

#### What if I can't complete the code challenges?

It's ok! The challenges don't have a unique solution, and are somewhat open-ended - so please submit whatever you have. If you found the prepwork too difficult, we will recommend some Python learning resources to get you ready before the next cohort.
