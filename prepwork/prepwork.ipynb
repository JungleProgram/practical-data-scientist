    "üëã **Welcome to the prepwork!**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Practical Data Scientist is a 6 weeks part-time micro-class to get you launched into the world of python data analysis üêç. At Jungle Program, a big part of the learning experience is the found in the community. We think classmates are just as important as your teachers for collaborative learning. As such, it is important for us to keep classes small, and for everyone joining to be of a similar level. This prepwork serves to test how comfortable you are with python. Some of you will breeze through it, some will enjoy the refresher, and others might want to stop by our [Python Essentials course](https://www.jungleprogram.com/python-essentials-data-science) before starting this one. Please don't fret about it, and have fun! üåû\n",
    "\n",
    "## Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "### Google Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "Google colab is a online environment for jupyter notebooks. We're using it for this prepwork because it allows you to write and execute Python in your browser with zero configuration required. [Here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb)'s an overview of the basic features which explains how to create, edit, and run cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Warnings\n",
    "\n",
    "When first running this notebook, you will encounter the following warning:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Warning: This notebook was not authored by Google.`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is expected and you can press `Run anyway`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google colab is integrated with many Google services, so you are warned about running external code. In this case, the code is the few python lines to setup the prepwork exercises. You are not only encouraged to review these lines, but expected to read through them thoroughly since they are essential to complete the prepwork üòÖ.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is loaded directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/JungleProgram/practical-data-scientist/blob/main/prepwork/prepwork.ipynb). In order to save your work, please make a copy of the notebook in your Drive:\n",
    "\n",
    "`File->Make a Copy`\n",
    "\n",
    "You will now find a `.ipynb` file in your Drive. To resume the prepwork, you can open this file directly in Google Drive, or open the [Google Colab homepage](https://colab.research.google.com/) and find it under the `Recent` tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the prepwork is completed, please download the notebook file:\n",
    "\n",
    "`File->Download->Download .ipynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "and upload it into the [Exercise Drop Zone](https://airtable.com/shri5saP3xxEDtrHQ).\n",
